# feijaoVermelho
ORM based on RedBeanPHP

# naming
"feij&atilde;o vermelho" simply means "red bean" in portuguese.

## idea
Since i am using RedBeanPHP in about a dozen projects or so, i really love the easypeasy possibilities to put objects into databases, read them, change them... A far as you design your objects to use RedBean from ground up, no problem.

What i wanted to archieve with this little lib is to use RedBeanPHP transparantly in the background for mostly an class/object in your projects...
